Scrolling Text
==============

Computer people in movies always have scrolling text on their screen.
This is done cause they are always in the middle of running some really powerful super awesome code that needs to take up a ton of their screen.  The goal of this program is to create a script that will walk through the user's directories and display nonsense text on the screen like in movies.  

More features to come in the future include: pausing to load/install nothing, routing to random directories and not just walk down the directory list and then jump up when it gets to the end.
